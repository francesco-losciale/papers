Notes watching Clean Code Video - Chicago vs London



Outside-in TDD:

+ The unit tests drive the architecture
+ Rest API behaviour/acceptance tests validate the architecture
+ Production code is enough to validate the behaviour, no exceeding logic

- Rest API behaviour/acceptance tests might not cover some negative scenario that needs to be checked at unit test level (for example there must be a Rest Assured test for checking the invalid password for a login api).
