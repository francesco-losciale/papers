Quotes

 Alberto Brandolini: “It is not the domain expert's knowledge that goes into production, it is the developer's assumption of that knowledge that goes into production.”

 Eric Evans: “When we are developing a software, our focus shouldn’t be on technology. It should be primarily on business or whatever activity we are trying to assist with software, the domain.”
 “Specifically, we approach that by trying to develop models of that domain and make our software conform to that.”
 “To communicate effectively, the code must be based on the same language used to write the requirements—the same language that the developers speak with each other and with domain experts.”
 
 George E. P. Box: “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.”



How to

- Decide the bounded context of your Event Storm
- A large context can be useful for wider organisation discoveries
- Keep your bounded context small and specific if you know the area you want to improve
- The hardest part: Getting the right people in a room at the same time
- Introduce everyone to the session by running through the key as this forms the different stages of the workshop




Keys (types of sticky notes):

Event 
A short and clear description of something which happens in the process
something that happens or time passing (eg "end of month") 
past tense verb

Pain, Risks and more info needed
Friction and frustrations associated to events

Systems, software or community/department
Add all the systems people user, including non tech systems such as phone calls, pen and paper

People, name, role, personas (eg. hr)
Add all the people who are part of this journey

Use emotions to highlight areas
+ emotion (money or time saved)
- emotion (waste)

Optional 
Opportunities
A quick brainstorm of ideas to solve problem areas


AFTER THE SESSION
